# 🧠 AI Labs — Quietly Building Autonomous Insight Systems

> Exploring Agentic AI, LLM-powered workflows, and value-first automation using Python, LangChain, and OpenAI.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

In a world of noise, I build quiet systems.

This lab is my sandbox for learning, testing, and building autonomous agents that:
- Make decisions
- Trigger actions
- Operate with minimal supervision
- Deliver structured insight from unstructured data

Inspired by the vision of **Agentic AI** — where models don’t just answer, but act.
